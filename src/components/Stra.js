<p><strong>Statement from the Board Chairman</strong></p>
<p>
Let me on behalf of the Board of Directors take this opportunity to thank our valued customers and business associates for their continued support and confidence in us. My sincere gratitude also goes to Technical Team and Staff of UNDI CONSULTING GROUP LTD for their outstanding performances that lead to the success for the year 2010.
They worked extremely hard and effectively for the business for the whole year.
</p>
<p>
The unprecedented world financial crises that lead to a global financial meltdown had prompted governments in developed and developing countries to make concerted efforts to stimulate their economies. Even with the global economic shakeup, with the exception of foreign funded projects, the level of investments to development projects in Tanzania continued to rise especially for projects funded by Pension Funds.
</p>
<p>
The rising opportunities from heavy investment in construction projects resulted into increase in number and value of awarded projects to our firm. As a result, the turnover for the year 2010 increased by 15% from 2009 figures. Our motto henceforth is to ensure the speed of growth is maintain and this cannot be achieved without the support of all of you in the market especially our current customers, new customers and our business associates. Thatâ€™s why I need not hesitate to once again thank you for being there for us.
</p>
<p>
One success lead to the other, in that regard we feel proud to share with you our future plans including growth and expansion targets for the coming three years as outline below. Let the Team spirit roll on.
</p>

<p><strong>Growth Targets</strong></p>

<b><i>Employment</i></b>

<p>
The target is to have 18 permanent staff from the current 11 employees and 12 professionals on contract basis by the end of 2011.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Revenue</i></b>
<br></br>
The company has positioned itself to ensure growth targets are met. Annual revenue growth is projected to be between 12-15% for the next three years from 2011.

<p>
<b><i>Office Expansion</i></b>

With completion of UNDI House the company intends to expand its Departments namely Civil & Structural, Electrical, Energy & Power Services, Mechanical Services, and Project Management. The new office shall also provide space for International Department to serve for International Projects.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>New Branches</i></b>
<br></br>
The company intends to reinforce the branch in Arusha which we opened temporary in 2009 to serve for three projects we have with National Social Security Fund and private investors. Arusha branch will come to an end in December 2011 when all staff are relocated to the head office in Dar es Salaam.
Our great achievement in the year 2010 is the establishment of UNDI CONSULTING GROUP CONGO S.p.r.l in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Our office in Congo is based in Lubumbashi. We have targeted to have our Congo office opened by March 2011.
